Odin Project #1 - Recipes (HTML)
-------------------------------------
Project: Create a recipe page
Stack: HTML

Thoughts: This project will demonstrate my ability to use html elements to present information on a web page. Additionally, completing this also gave me experience with publishing a complete project to GitHub using git.
