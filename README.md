Odin Project #1 - Recipes (HTML)
-------------------------------------
Project: Create a recipe page
Stack: HTML, CSS

Thoughts: This project will demonstrate my ability to use html elements to present information on a web page. Additionally, completing this also gave me experience with publishing a complete project to GitHub using git.

Update: I just finished customizing the visuals a bit with css for the first time. it was pretty interesting to try out for the first time.
